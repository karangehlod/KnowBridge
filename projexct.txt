By enabling researchers to ask natural language queries and receive meaningful, connected answers, this project accelerates the discovery of innovative solutions.

### **Features**
1. **Semantic Search Across Research Domains**:
   - Understand and retrieve insights across diverse research topics.
   - Leverage the **Neo4j knowledge graph** for semantic relationships.
2. **Dynamic Query Translation**:
   - Transform natural language queries into **Cypher queries** using **Modus API**.
3. **Insight Summarization**:
   - Generate human-readable summaries of research connections using **Azure OpenAI**.
4. **Graph Visualizations**:
   - Provide visual representations of relationships between research topics, authors, and fields using a React.js frontend.

## **System Architecture**

1. **User Input**:
   - A researcher provides a natural language query like:
     *"How does nanotechnology relate to renewable energy research?"*
   
2. **FastAPI Backend**:
   - Receives the user query via an API request.
   - Calls the **Modus API** to translate the query into a **Cypher query** for Neo4j.

3. **Neo4j Knowledge Graph**:
   - Executes the **Cypher query** to retrieve relevant nodes and relationships.
   - Returns graph data (e.g., papers, authors, domains, and their relationships).

4. **Azure OpenAI Model**:
   - Summarizes the retrieved data into a user-friendly, natural language response.
   - Optionally, generates insights or recommendations based on the data.

5. **React.js Frontend**:
   - Displays:
     - The textual summary.
     - Interactive graph visualizations showing relationships between nodes.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Application is containerized using **Docker** for easy deployment on cloud platforms.

## **Detailed Breakdown of Each Component**

### **1. FastAPI Backend**
#### **Functionality**:
- Acts as the glue between the frontend, Modus API, and Neo4j.
- Processes incoming user queries and coordinates the response pipeline.

#### **Key Responsibilities**:
- Accept queries via HTTP POST requests.
- Interact with **Modus API** for AI and knowledge graph processing.
- Serve JSON responses to the React.js frontend.

#### **Code Snippet**:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
import modus

app = FastAPI()
modus_client = modus.Client(api_key="your_modus_api_key")

class Query(BaseModel):
    user_query: str

@app.post("/query")
async def process_query(query: Query):
    # Translate user input into Cypher query using Modus
    cypher_response = modus_client.models().call(
        model="cypher-translate", 
        input=query.user_query
    )
    cypher_query = cypher_response["result"]

    # Query Neo4j via Modus
    graph_response = modus_client.knowledge_graph().query(query=cypher_query)

    # Summarize results using Azure OpenAI (via Modus)
    summary = modus_client.models().call(
        model="gpt-4", 
        input=f"Summarize the following data: {graph_response}"
    )

    return {
        "cypher_query": cypher_query,
        "graph_response": graph_response,
        "summary": summary["result"]
    }
```

### **2. Neo4j Knowledge Graph**
#### **Functionality**:
- Stores research data (e.g., papers, topics, relationships between concepts).
- Handles **semantic relationships** between data points.

#### **Key Responsibilities**:
- Serve as the core database for storing graph-based data.
- Provide relationship-rich data via Cypher queries.

#### **Data Example**:
- Nodes:
  - `ResearchPaper`: `{title: "Nanotechnology in Renewable Energy"}`
  - `Topic`: `{name: "Renewable Energy"}`
- Relationships:
  - `(ResearchPaper)-[:RELATES_TO]->(Topic)`
